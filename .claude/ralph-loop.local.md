All right now we have three sessions. We need to make sure that our front-end reflects the name of the profile in the front-end for easy management. So we have saved credentials where we have a credentials list. Once the session is connected, I have no idea what is the name of the person because the name of the profile is not reflected. And if you go in our sessions, they all have some random names.

Your task is to achieve successfully when all of our three active sessions that are active right now so that they are ALL with the relevant profile name. So that we know exact first name and last name of each of them. All of them have separate sessions, separate fingerprints, and profile always gets to use the same session. Which means one profile uses one session, another profile uses another session.

So the front-end has to reflect it: what is the first and last name. And you will have to make sure that you always have relevant to-do list that is extremely specific and relevant.

And after all sessions are named properly, you go from the front-end, you use this target URL, and you use these three comments. And after you click Preview Jobs and then you click Run Campaign. You verify that all of them have successfully posted under this URL.   ## Rules
  - ALWAYS check Railway logs before changing code
  - ALWAYS develop a long term sustainable and working process with satisfying frontend UX.
  - ALWAYS use dump_interactive_elements() data to fix selectors
  - NEVER guess - use actual page state from logs/screenshots
  - Push and verify deployment before retesting” --completion-promise 3 SESSIONS NAMED ACCORDINGLY AND 3 COMMENTS POSTED THROUGH THE FRONTEND SUCCESSFULLY AND VERIFIED“
